       "\"A fundamental question!\\n\\nAn atom is the smallest unit of ordinary matter that forms a chemical element. It's made up of three main parts: protons, neutrons, and electrons.\\n\\n* Protons and neutrons are found in the nucleus (center) of the atom, and they have a positive charge.\\n* Electrons orbit around the nucleus, and they have a negative charge.\\n* The number of protons in an atom determines the element it represents. For example, hydrogen has one proton, helium has two, and so on.\\n\\nThink of an atom like a tiny solar system, with the nucleus as the sun and the electrons as planets orbiting around it!\\n\\nDoes that make sense?\""
